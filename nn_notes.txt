The basic idea I have for the neural network is to give it as input a bunch of values for indicators or anything really at a given date
	Then the prediction should be ln( <price sometime in the future> / <today's price> ). 1 month?

Stuff that is proportional to price like ema and psar should be divided by the price
	Probably book value and earnings if we do that

Take the log of multiplicitive things

Probably want to standardize across the data

Use things related to volume
	We want some indicator that stays around some mean, and wouldn't go super high if the volume explodes (when btc takes off or something)
		As a simple example, derivative of volume
		EMAs of volume for different periods makes some sense
	May still want to use the volume itself. High volume assets probably behave differently than low ones.

Should we also standardize within data?
	Perhaps the mean and std of the data itself is information we don't want to lose

Include market cap

Do we want something based on volitility? 

In general, do we want to give it specific indicators, or more general things like price, volume, momentum, etc. and allow it more freedom?
